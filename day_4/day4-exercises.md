##  In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?

The `alt` attribute provides a description of the image for those who cannot see it and search engines.

##  What determines if an image element is inline or block?

Whether or not it's placed within another element (for instance a paragraph)

##  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?

.jpg can handle a lot of color, while .png is better for low color images. .png can also use transparency.

##  What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?

When you use consistent sizing you can control all the image sizing with a few lines of code.

##  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?

An image sprite is an image which contains multiple elements (logos, buttons, different versions of the same button.) Only displaying part of the image makes it usable in different instances, and allows the website to only have to load one image for multiple elements.
